- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexamahajan
- 📚 I'm a BFA Digital Arts major, minoring in Computer Science and Math. 
- 👀 I’m interested in animation, particularly 3D animation for feature films, as well as computer programming. My dream is to be a technical director. I'm passionate about finding ways to use both my left and right brain, not holding the artistic and analytical as disparate but rather learning how art and technology go hand in hand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use OSL for custom shader creation, developing toon and sketch shaders in Blender and Unity. I'm also continuing to refine and develop UIs for Wordpress as well as Python tools for use in Maya and Houdini. Programs I'm working in include Maya, Houdini, Blender, Zbrush, Unity, Processing, and Photoshop. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scripting for 3D software and shader development in OSL/RSL.
