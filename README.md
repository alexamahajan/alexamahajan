- 👋 Hi, I’m @alexamahajan
- 📚 I'm a BFA major in Digital Arts, minoring in Computer Science and Math. 
- 👀 I’m interested in animation, particularly 3D animation for feature films, as well as computer programming. My dream is to be a technical director. I'm passionate about finding ways to use both my left and right brain, not holding the artistic and analytical as disparate but rather learning how art and technology go hand in hand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Ajax with Wordpress to create comprehensive post-filtering buttons to enhance user interaction and experience when looking through mass amounts of information. I'm also working on advancing my skills in html, css, JavaScript and php. Programs I'm working in include Maya, Blender, Cinema 4d, Unity, and Photoshop. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Wordpress user interface design and enhancing user experience. I'm also interested in learning more about OSL for custom shader creation and scripting for Maya.
